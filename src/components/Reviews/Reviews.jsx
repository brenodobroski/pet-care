          The only place i will leave my little girl when <br /> I go away. The
          only issue is she dont want <br /> to come home because she is having
          so <br /> much fun. The best part is the accessibillity <br /> to the
          staff and pictures on Facebook of <br /> playtime. I could not feel
          more confident in <br /> who is taking care of my pup while being
          <br /> out of town.
